Title: Limits & Continuity
Starting out with a scenario:
“Let’s consider an equation y=1/x and look at how y behaves as x increases”
Animator is requested to animate a x, y value table and end it with ellipsis.
//CLEAR SCREEN//
Animator is requested to Animate a Graph of y = 1/x at the same rate as the text explaining that “as the value of x increase, notice that the value of y decreases, but never reaches 0, no matter how large x gets.
If possible: in the “No matter how large x gets” zoom into the graph showing that it never touched the x-axis.
“Here, the “Limiting” (in different color) value of y is 0.” “Limit deals with values that come very close to each other but never meet”
Equation of limit is expressed as:
limx→af(x)=l
This equation is read as, 'As x approaches a, the limit of f(x) is l.'

Sub-topic: Identifying Continuous Function
- Define what a continuous function is.
- Animate a graph saying “you can draw this without lifting your pen”
- Let’s see if y = sin(x) is continuous. Animate the same.
